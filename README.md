# Database

This is a database System we developed to manage data adminstration as well as proving
access control, different models are used to control the access basing on the security level 
of the login user.


We divided the system into two parts: the control part and the operation part. 
The control part will take user input and call the operation part according to the user input 
and the operation part will actually talk with the database and retrieve the information user requested.
